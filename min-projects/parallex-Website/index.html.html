        <h2>A Forest for the Next Generations</h2>
        <P>
            As part of their summer jobs, three teenagers—members of the Prince of Wales Alaska Youth
            Stewards work crew—are being asked by Quinn Aboudara to become time travelers. Stay with him here.

            They’re standing at the foot of a tumble of rocks and uprooted trees that was the result of a 2020
            landslide on Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska. Aboudara, 41, grew up down the street and was
            raised by the land’s original stewards—the Tlingit & Haida people who have lived in the area since the
            last Ice Age. When he was the same age as his crew of local teens, this spot was a salmon spawning
            stream. Since he knows what it was, he also sees how it can be restored.

            “I want you to start looking at the lands as they are now, and start envisioning what they’ll look like in
            10, 20, 40 years,” says Aboudara, the natural resource coordinator for Shaan Seet Incorporated,
            the local Native village corporation.

            As part of their 10-week summer job, the Alaska Youth Stewards are working with Aboudara and
            land managers like him on natural resource and cultural stewardship projects to gain job experience
            and leadership skills. Each crew member wears XtraTuf rain boots and high school sports sweatshirts
            with their name printed on the back.

        <h2 class="Dark" >Amazon Rainforest Nearing Savannah “Tipping Point”</h2>
        <P class="Dark">The Amazon rainforest’s trees may soon die off en masse, researchers warn.
             According to a 20-year satellite study published yesterday (March 7) in Nature Climate Change,
              the famous forest is exhibiting signs of poor health that could mean large portions of it will 
              become savannah in the near future. Such an ecological shift could happen quickly, Timothy M.
              Lenton, a coauthor on the study and a director of the Global Systems Institute at the University 
              of Exeter, tells CNN. “My hunch, for what it’s worth, (is that) it could happen in the space of decades.”

            “The Amazon is a custodian of biodiversity and possesses a vital ability to pull in carbon dioxide
             from the atmosphere, so it is clearly concerning that its health is deteriorating as human-caused
              deforestation and climate change metes out increasingly potent and harmful impacts on the ecosystem,” 
              University of Reading climate scientist Richard Allan, who was not involved in the study, 
              says in a statement to the Science Media Centre (SMC).  
            
            Covering more than 6 million square kilometers and spanning parts of eight countries,
            the Amazon basin is home to the largest forest in the world—bigger than the next two largest
             forests combined. Approximately one-fifth of the forest has already been lost since
              pre-industrial times, the study’s authors tell BBC News, and the rest is threatened by
               deforestation and climate change. To measure the massive forest’s resilience, 
               researchers analyzed satellite data to determine the biomass and greenness 
               of the forest from 1991–2006, looking for month-to-month changes in response 
               to weather conditions. More than three-quarters of the forest exhibited reduced 
               resilience since 2000, with trees taking longer to recover from stresses like droughts
                and fires. The most pronounced resilience loss occurred in areas with less rainfall
                and those geographically nearer to human activity, the researchers report.

        <h2>beauty of nature</h2>
        <P>
            The beauty of nature lies in its freshness, openness, 
            slow breeze and the warm sun – relief for our brains. Nature is made 
            of everything we see around us the trees, flowers, plants, animals, sky,
             mountains, forests and more. We find many colors in nature which make the Earth 
             beautiful.Many beautiful living things are among the countless riches of beauty that 
             nature has to offer. Millions of different species in every size, colour, and habitat—on land, 
             in the sky, and in the water—abound in the world of birds, animals, reptiles, and fish. 
             They are present all the time and everywhere.Natural environments can stimulate the senses, 
             providing new and fresh scents, a beautiful array of colours to see, a range of textures 
             to touch and a host of calming sounds. We've got to say, there's something special about 
             walking through woodlands after a light shower!The natural environment gives us a wealth 
             of services that are difficult to measure in dollars. Natural areas help clean our air, 
             purify our water, produce food and medicines, reduce chemical and noise pollution, slow floodwaters,
              and cool our streets. We call this work 'ecosystem services'.Everything we see around 
              us constitutes nature, including the sun, the moon, trees, flowers, fruits, human beings,
               birds, animals, etc. In nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy.
                For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another.

        <h2 class="Dark"> Uncertain Waters</h2>
        <P class="Dark">
           Nothing prepared me for the quiet of Georgia’s Okefenokee Swamp. I am from Florida,
             where I learned to associate swamps with the roar of airboat engines. But on this April day near
              the Florida-Georgia border, it’s so still I can hear the low whistle of every breeze passing through
               the Spanish moss-draped cypress trees that tower over the water’s edge. The only other sound is
                that of our paddles swishing the water as my 16-year-old son Luke and I propel our little green
                 rented canoe into the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge. All around us, the still, black water
                  perfectly reflects everything in view, creating a dreamy effect where the trees, sky and clouds
                   appear above and below us. 
            “This is amazing,” Luke quietly says to himself. 
            He rests his paddle across his knees and tilts his head back to take in the sight.
             I do, too. Staring up at this cathedral of cypress, it’s incredible to think that the 
             fate of this place—the largest blackwater swamp in America—is so up in the air. The Department 
             of the Interior is considering whether to nominate it for inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage 
             Site list, which would recognize Okefenokee as a natural place of international significance. 
             On the other hand, it also might be irreparably damaged by a proposed titanium dioxide mine that just
              moved closer to approval by the state.
